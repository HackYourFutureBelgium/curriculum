# HackYourFuture Belgium

> If you aren't already, [read this repo as a GitBook](https://curriculum.hackyourfuture.be). it's much nicer.

Welcome to HYF.

Each module is built around the set of skills necessary to build one type of project. In each module you'll learn a little bit of a lot of things, pulling together the skills needed to build and deploy increasingly complex projects.  Very simple projects at first, but building on each other from module to module until by the end, you are comfortable building and deploying your own fullstack app!

As you work your way through Hack Your Future BE, you'll never fully be comfortable with the skills and technologies you are using.  That is normal.  There is a lot of material to learn, and none of it is easy.  This course is designed to help you gain confidence in the face of this uncertainty.   Even your coaches, experienced professional developers, are always learning always uncertain and always building working apps with technologies they don't fully understand.

What's more important than mastering any particular skill, JS language feature, or development tool is learning to plan and build projects from start to finish.  You can always learn the specific skills & technologies you need when you need them, but if you don't know how to put together a project you can't even make it that far!
